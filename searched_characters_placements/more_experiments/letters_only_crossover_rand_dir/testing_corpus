so, i think in the next 20 years, if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence, like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say, can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem? some problems are good for neural nets; we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them.
for my second project, i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before.
it seems that this story helped change perceptions about the dfs, at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions, read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.
