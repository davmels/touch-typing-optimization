they've had billions of years to do it, but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.
so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that, in cooking, we can transform it to the form.
this is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain.
well, i think there are about three reasons technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies, what i call everyday living -- to function in the world today, you've got to be pretty quantitative, much more so than a few years ago figure out your mortgages, being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things -- and thirdly, what i would call something like logical mind training, logical thinking.
so in addition to doing the transplant, we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell.

so that's really the crux of the research, and to do that, we need to go one more step.
and about two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85, many by norwegian vessels.
so, these are the civic leaders of the future.

three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of la scala, musical employees, i mean the musicians, saying, you're a great conductor. we don't want to work with you. please resign.
and here the standard scenario is that we create these things, they grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us, and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.

we're not going to be able to do that.
within a short while, i think there's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics, because with these new synthesis capabilities, these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination, we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
this guy over here of course is me.
every time i am home i am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most nigerians our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it.

this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube.
so here's a little fractal model for it.
you will spend less time compared to you.
but, quite frankly, on this issue, there is no other road.
so i thought, well they like to play games.
now imagine an object, amazing object, or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say, look, we give up. physics doesn't work.
many of the women are married with children, and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children.

tbl alright, raw data now
the accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin's life.
well i'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we got hold of an old brain, and we're going to say it's like a non-mammal, like a reptile, so i'll say, an alligator; we have an alligator.
it eventually only plays songs you like.
guess what fixed that. guess what fixed that two one-hour sessions.
